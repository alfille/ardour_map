Ardour (DAW) MIDI maps for some devices -- AKAI MPD226 and others

[Audour](https://audour.org) is a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) for creating and editing music.

Some devices, like the [AKAI MPD226](https://www.akaipro.com/usb-pad-controller-with-rgb.html) are MIDI controllers (and a drum machine).

Although there are built-in connections for MIDI device button and controls for some DAWs, Ardour is not included.

This project is my attempt at creating usable MIDI bindings.
